	Have an Acrobat x64 package from the CC portal ready. Does not have to be latest version.

	Create an administrative Installation-Image:
	msiexec /a AcroPro.msi TARGETDIR=D:\AutoPkg\Build\\AcrobatDC_64_19.010.20091_ML\adm
	
	Update the AIP with Patch 19.010.20091:
	msiexec /p AcrobatDCx64Upd.msp /a AcroPro.msi TARGETDIR=C:\MSI\AdobeReaderDC_64_19.010.20091_deu\adm

	Create a new CAB-File and embed it:
	cscript MultiMakeCab.vbs AcrobatDC_64_23.008.20421_ML.msi Data1 /L /C /U /E


	MultiMakeCab.vbs is a slightly changed version of WiMakCab.vbs from the Installer-SDK.

	outStream.WriteLine ".Set CompressionLevel=7"
	outStream.WriteLine ".Set CompressionMemory=21"

	cscript ..\..\MSIScripts\WiStream.vbs AcrobatDC_64_23.008.20421_ML.msi /D AdminProperties

	Change the product code. Adobe converts the version string into hex and works it into the GUID!
	Completely BS, but it is like it is..
	Ex product code: {AC76BA86-1033-FFFF-7760-BC15014EA700} , ProductVersion: 21.001.20135
	The version is in the last tuple, the first two chars "BC" are constants.
	The 3+4 Byte is the mayor version in Hex.
	The 5+6 Byte is the mayorminor version in Hex.
	The Bytes 7-10 are the minorminor version in Hex.

	Insert a new Package Code.

	The configuration changes ar made with the Acrobat Customization Wizard DC.
	See the MST-files for the changes.
