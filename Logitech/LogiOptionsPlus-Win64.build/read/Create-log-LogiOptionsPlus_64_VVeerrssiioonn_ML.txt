200113	Create Logitech Options+ for Windows x64
	Download Logitech Options+ Offline installer
	From: https://download01.logi.com/web/ftp/pub/techsupport/optionsplus/logioptionsplus_installer_offline.exe
	Analyzing the installer package
	It is no common installer from a well known source.
	Looks like Logitech builds it without external help.

	So, we use it with no alterations at all.
	And try to disable as much BS as possible.
	Options: /analytics no /flow no /sso no /update no /logivoice no /aipromptbuilder no /device-recommendation no /quiet
