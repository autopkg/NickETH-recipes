190207	Get the installer stub from: https://www.mindmanager.com/mm-win-exe
	From there, we need to extract installparams.js, which contains the path to
	the actual installerlistMMDxxx.js on cloudfront.net.
	In there finally lies the real download path to the MSI files we need to get.
	See the download recipe for more information.
	The MSI files are full installers.
	The installed software is multi-language
	However, to install with a certain default language, we can use the property:
	RESOURCELANGUAGE="English" or "German" and a few others too.

	There is also an administrative download, but the MSI in it is just the same as well.

	Command line switches:
	/qn /norestart ALLUSERS=1 RESOURCELANGUAGE="English" LAUNCHPROGRAM=0 SHORTCUTDESKTOP=0 SHORTCUTQUICKLAUNCH=0 EULA_REGION=5 LAUNCHREGISTRATION=0 
	ADDLOCAL=ALL REMOVE="Box,GoogleDrive,DropBox,MindManagerSnap"
	Features removed: Box,GoogleDrive,DropBox,MindManagerSnap
