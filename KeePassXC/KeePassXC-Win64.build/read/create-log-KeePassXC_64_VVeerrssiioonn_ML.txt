200113	Packaging KeePassXC x64
	We download the MSI as is.
	Alterations:
	We create an advertised shortcut.
	And advertised shortcut needs an exe icon-file.
	So we export the Icon Group IDI_ICON1 as .ico file.
	Then we create an standalone Icon-file with Greenfish Icon Editor Pro.
	New library, import the element.ico and save it as icon library with an .exe extension in 32-bit PE format.
	The inner name seems not to be important.
	The RemoveShortcuts action is missing in InstallExecuteSequence. We add it.
	For the download links, see the recipe.
