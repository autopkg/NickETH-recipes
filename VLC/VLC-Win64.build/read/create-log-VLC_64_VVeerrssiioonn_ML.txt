200113	Create VLC x64 for Windows MSI package.
	We alter/enhance the package with the following things:
	- The MSI which was built on a Linux WINE emulation was not 100% compatible.
		Biggest problem, it does not accept transforms!
		See: https://packageology.com/msi/fixing-vlcs-msi-package/
		To solve this issue, we repack the MSI with MSIofflinePatcher
		That means unpack to an admin-install and pack it again.
	- With version 3.0.21, the VideoLAN team was not able to release an MSI version.
		We now generate MSI with AutoPkg, using the orginal Wix config from VLC.
	- Disabling the auto-update is not possible in a per machine setting.
		So, we do it on the user-level with an Active Setup entry.
		To do this the fastest possible way, we introduce a new feature "User" 
		See the transform for details.
	- Firewall settings are missing.
		We do this with a merge-module, which contains the additions to use the Wix-Firewall-Extension.
		The actual settings are put in with the transform.
	- We remove the desktop shortcut.
		This is also part of the transform.
	See the AutoPkg recipe for more details.
